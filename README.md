Every AI workflow that touches biomedical literature hits the same wall:

1. **Download** PMC XML hoping it’s “structured.”
2. **Fight** nested tags, footnotes, figure refs, and half-broken links.
3. **Hope** your regex didn’t blow away the Methods section you actually need.

That wall steals hours from **RAG pipelines, knowledge-graph builds, LLM fine-tuning—any downstream AI task**.
**PMCGrab knocks it down.** Feed the tool a list of PMC IDs and get back clean, section-aware JSON you can drop straight into a vector DB or LLM prompt.

## The Hidden Cost of “I’ll Just Parse It Myself”

| Task                        | Manual / ad-hoc         | **PMCGrab**                    |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Install dependencies        | 5–10 min                | **≈ 2 s** (`uv add pmcgrab`)   |
| Convert one article to JSON | 15–30 min               | **≈ 3 s**                      |
| Capture every IMRaD section | Hope & regex            | **98 % detection accuracy\***  |
| Parallel processing         | Bash loops & temp files | `--workers N` flag             |
| Edge-case maintenance       | Yours forever           | **200 + tests**, active upkeep |

**_Evaluated on 7,500 PMC papers used in a disease-specific knowledge-graph pipeline._**

At \$50 /hour, hand-parsing 100 papers burns **\$1,000+**.
PMCGrab does the same job for \$0—within minutes—so you can focus on _using_ the information instead of extracting it.

## Quick Install

```bash
uv add pmcgrab          # fastest
```

Python ≥ 3.10 required.

---

## Two Ways to Use

### 1 · Python API

```python
from pmcgrab.application.processing import process_single_pmc

article = process_single_pmc("7114487")
print(article)
```

### 2 · Command Line

```bash
uv run python -m pmcgrab --pmcids 7114487 3084273 --workers 4
# → writes pmc_output/PMC7114487.json, PMC3084273.json
```

(Use the numeric part of the PMC ID only.)

---

## Output Example

```json
{
  "pmc_id": "7114487",
  "title": "Machine learning approaches in cancer research",
  "abstract": "…",
  "body": {
    "Introduction": "…",
    "Methods": "…",
    "Results": "…",
    "Discussion": "…"
  },
  "authors": [...],
  "journal": "Nature Medicine"
}
```

## Context Engineering: Why This Matters for LLMs

Large-language-model performance lives or dies on **context quality**—the snippets you retrieve and feed back into the model:

- **RAG pipelines** need precise, de-duplicated passages to ground answers.
- **Knowledge-graph population** demands reliable section boundaries (e.g., Methods vs. Results) to classify triples accurately.
- **Fine-tuning & few-shot prompting** work best with noise-free, domain-specific examples.

PMCGrab _is_ a context-engineering tool: it converts messy XML into **clean, section-aware, UTF-8 JSON** that slots directly into embeddings, vector stores, or prompt templates. No preprocessing gymnastics, no guessing where the Methods section starts, no hallucinations from half-garbled text. Better input → better retrieval → better answers.

## Why PMCGrab Beats Home-Grown Scripts

1. **Section-Aware Parsing**
   Detects IMRaD plus custom subsections like _Statistical Analysis_—crucial for accurate retrieval scoring.

2. **Resilient XML Cleaning**
   Removes cross-refs and figure stubs without dropping scientific content, preserving token-level fidelity for embeddings.

3. **True Concurrency**
   `--workers` fan-outs across all CPU cores; automatic email rotation respects NCBI rate limits so large harvests don’t throttle.

4. **Modern Python Stack**
   Type-safe (`mypy`), linted (`ruff`), CI-checked on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows.

| Branch coverage             | **95 %**           |
| Section detection accuracy  | **98 %**           |
| Median parse time / article | **3.1 s**          |
| Largest batch processed     | **7,500 articles** |

## Promise to you

If PMCGrab doesn’t save you hours on day one, delete it—no questions asked.
Once you see clean JSON in seconds, you’ll never fight PMC XML again.
