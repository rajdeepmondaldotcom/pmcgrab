        "### What You Can Do Next:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Scale Up**: Process hundreds or thousands of papers using PMCGrab's batch processing\n",
        "2. **Vector Database**: Load your RAG chunks into Pinecone, Weaviate, or ChromaDB\n",
        "3. **Fine-tune Models**: Use training examples to fine-tune GPT, Llama, or other LLMs\n",
        "4. **Build Knowledge Graphs**: Use Neo4j or similar to create interactive knowledge networks\n",
        "5. **Research Analysis**: Apply NLP techniques to analyze trends, topics, and relationships\n",

        "\n",
        "- Use `uv run` for faster execution and dependency management\n",
        "- Use `--workers N` flag for parallel processing when running from command line\n",
        "- PMCGrab handles rate limiting automatically, so you don't need to worry about NCBI limits\n",
