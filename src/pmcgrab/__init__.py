"""PMCGrab: AI-ready retrieval and parsing of PubMed Central articles.

PMCGrab is a specialized Python toolkit for retrieving, validating and
restructuring PubMed Central (PMC) articles into clean, section-aware JSON
that large-language-model (LLM) pipelines can ingest directly for
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), question-answering, summarization
and other downstream tasks.

Key Features:
    * **Effortless Retrieval**: Fetch full-text articles with a single PMCID using NCBI Entrez
    * **AI-Optimized JSON**: Output is pre-segmented into Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, etc.
    * **Highly Concurrent**: Multithreaded batch downloader with configurable worker count, retries and timeouts
    * **HTML & Reference Cleaning**: Utilities to strip or normalize embedded HTML, citations and footnotes

Examples:
    Basic usage for retrieving a single paper:

        >>> from pmcgrab import Paper
        >>> paper = Paper.from_pmc("7181753", email="your-email@example.com")
        >>> print(paper.title)
        >>> print(paper.body["Introduction"][:500])

    Batch processing multiple papers:

        >>> from pmcgrab import process_pmc_ids_in_batches
        >>> pmc_ids = ["7181753", "3539614", "5454911"]
        >>> process_pmc_ids_in_batches(pmc_ids, "./output", batch_size=8)

Classes:
    Paper: Container for all parsed information about a PMC article

Functions:
    get_xml: Fetch, parse and optionally validate XML for a PMCID
    paper_dict_from_pmc: Convert PMC article to structured dictionary
    build_complete_paper_dict: Low-level orchestrator for parsing PMC XML
    process_single_pmc: Download and parse a single PMC article
    process_pmc_ids_in_batches: Process multiple PMC IDs concurrently
    process_in_batches: Process PMC IDs in sequential chunks
    process_in_batches_with_retry: Batch processing with automatic retries

External Service Functions:
    bioc_fetch: Fetch JSON from BioC service
    id_convert: Convert between different identifier types
    citation_export: Export citations in various formats
    oa_fetch: Fetch from Open Access service
    oai_get_record: Get OAI-PMH record
    oai_list_identifiers: List OAI-PMH identifiers
    oai_list_records: List OAI-PMH records
    oai_list_sets: List OAI-PMH sets
